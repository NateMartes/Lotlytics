  description: |
    The **Lotlytics API** is a RESTful service that provides programmatic access 
    to the resources and data used by the Lotlytics platform.
  
    It is organized around three primary endpoints:
      - **/lot** — Manage and retrieve parking lot resources.
      - **/group** — Access and manage parking lot group resources.
      - **/event** — Create, and record event data.
  
    All endpoints follow RESTful principles and are stateless, ensuring 
    predictable, consistent, and scalable interactions.
