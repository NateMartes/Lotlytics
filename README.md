# Lotlytics - All The Data for Your Lots, Anywhere. W.I.P

**Lotlytics** is a web application that allows users to create and view parking lots from different services to plan their trips and reduce overall stress.  

Lotlytics aggregates the volume of vehicles in each lot and makes the information readily available using the cloud.  

Edge devices are deployed in parking lots to keep track of vehicles, and the volume data is updated accordingly.  
Users can then view the Lotlytics web application to discover parking lots and get directions to them.
